# REAM
Rust Erlang Abstract Machine

The goal of this project is to re-implement the majority of the BEAM in Rust
as an embeddable library for rust programs. This project is (for now) purely for
my personal enjoyment and learning experiance; as such, there should be no
expectation that this implmentation will run fast or at all.
